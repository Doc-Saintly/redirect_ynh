# This is a multi-instance app, meaning it can be installed several times independently
# The id of the app as stated in the manifest is available as $YNH_APP_ID
# The instance number is available as $YNH_APP_INSTANCE_NUMBER (equals "1", "2", ...)
# The app instance name is available as $YNH_APP_INSTANCE_NAME
#    - the first time the app is installed, YNH_APP_INSTANCE_NAME = ynhexample
#    - the second time the app is installed, YNH_APP_INSTANCE_NAME = ynhexample__2
#    - ynhexample__{N} for the subsequent installations, with N=3,4, ...
# The app instance name is probably what you are interested the most, since this is
# guaranteed to be unique. This is a good unique identifier to define installation path,
# db names, ...
